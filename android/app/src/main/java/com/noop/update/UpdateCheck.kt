/**
 * "Check for updates": a single call to the project's PUBLIC releases API (GitHub) that reads the latest
 * version and compares it to the installed one. Nothing about the user is sent, and it never installs
 * anything.
 *
 * TWO callers share this, and the distinction matters to anyone auditing what the app does on its own:
 *  - the Settings button, which runs only when tapped;
 *  - [UpdateWatch], the #1659 daily check, which runs at most once a day after onboarding and the Terms
 *    gate. It is ON by default and switching it off in Settings stops the request entirely.
 *
 * This header previously said the read happened ONLY on a tap. That stopped being true the moment the
 * automatic caller was added, and a false claim here is worse than none: it is the file someone opens to
 * answer "does this app poll?". Documented for real in docs/PRIVACY_SECURITY.md §1.1c.
 *
 * (Android already holds INTERNET for the opt-in AI Coach, so this adds no new capability.)
